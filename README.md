Experiments in Generative Art with P5.js


Inspiration and original code:
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/generative-art-3-fundamental-concepts-to-get-you-started-44205dae167b

Color codes from: https://coolors.co/

Color Convertor: https://www.webfx.com/web-design/hex-to-rgb/

The purpose of this project is to explore the P5.js library in terms of a potential tool for generative art.

Examples will show various ways to refactor similar code.

Future plans:
1. Add interactions so the user can change colours and elements within the art by mouse interactions
2. Generate unique and original art
